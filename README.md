The experience demo of OutfitAnyone v0.9 is now available on <a href = 'https://huggingface.co/spaces/HumanAIGC/OutfitAnyone' >Hugging Face</a>.
 
To prevent the malicious use of personal photos, we have currently limited our feature to only allow the upload of clothing images. All models displayed are pre-set and generated using our AI model to ensure safety and privacy.
